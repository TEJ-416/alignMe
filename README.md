AlignMe is a posture tracking system that utilizes computer vision technology to monitor the movement of joints during exercise routines. The system is designed to ensure correct posture and reduce the risk of injury. 

Incorrect posture is a common cause of injuries during exercise. Poor alignment places undue stress on joints, ligaments, and muscles, leading to discomfort, pain, and even long-term damage. AlignMe aims to address this problem by providing real-time feedback to users, helping them correct their form and maintain proper alignment. 

The system uses a camera to capture the user's movements during exercise, which are then analysed by the computer vision algorithm. The algorithm identifies the position of the user's joints and tracks their movement throughout the exercise routine. The system then provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their form is correct or incorrect.
